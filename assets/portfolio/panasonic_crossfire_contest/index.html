        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        Panasonic India wanted a scalable way to lift product knowledge, competitive awareness, policy/process clarity,
        and practical selling skills across a large channel sales workforce. Instead of a traditional course, we designed
        the <strong>Crossfire Contest</strong>—a nationwide, multi-round competition where employees learned, qualified,
        and competed for <strong>cash prizes and national recognition</strong>. The contest format drove motivation and
        sustained participation while giving leadership clear, comparable evidence of capability growth.

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Rounds 1–2 (Online):</strong> timed objective assessments covering products, competitors, policies, and sales skills. Question banks were shared in advance to promote self-learning and consistent prep.</li>

        <li><strong>Finals (National):</strong> live, game-show style quiz with multiple rounds—individual questions, rapid fire, buzzer rounds, and extempore—staged in front of senior leadership with a professional presenter.</li>
      </ul>
